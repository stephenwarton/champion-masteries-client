# Champion Masteries

A simple web app to check your champion mastery stats. Only implemented for the NA server for now. This is the repo for the frontend/client. The backend/server repo can be found here: [champion-masteries-server](https://github.com/stephenwarton/champion-masteries-server).

## Getting Started

After downloading/cloning you will need to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
Make sure the server is running first. The instructions for setting up the server can be found here: [champion-masteries-server](https://github.com/stephenwarton/champion-masteries-server).

To run the client:

```
npm start
```
Say yes for the next prompt to run the client on another port and you're good to go.

If for some reason you need to run the server on a different port, you'll need to change this line: [](https://github.com/stephenwarton/champion-masteries-client/blob/master/src/App.js#L8)
